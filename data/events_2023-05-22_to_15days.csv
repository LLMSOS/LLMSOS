By combining cruise water column observations, with remote sensing of chlorophyll and bioassay experiments we can however gain some insight into the links between liquid/solid ice sheet discharge and marine biogeochemistry. In addition to physical effects from icebergs and glaciers mixing the water column, the release of high sediment loads may negatively affect light availability or prove fatal to grazers. Conversely the release of trace metals associated with iceberg/glacier melt could have fertilizing effects on phytoplankton. By combining an extensive compilation of 500 ice meltwater samples for (micro)nutrient content with incubation experiments in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and Greenland to test the response of phytoplankton communities to increasing freshwater and sediment, we aim to increase understanding of cryosphere-ocean linkages.

Whilst iceberg melt was consistently found to act as a modest source of (micro)nutrients, particularly the bioessential trace metals iron and manganese (mean concentrations 88 nM dFe, 29 nM dMn, 0.64 µM dSi), the response of primary producers in both Greenland and the WAP to increasing meltwater was limited suggesting trace metal concentrations were already replete in the water column. Furthermore, in the WAP a negative response was observed when salinity declined by more than 2 psu suggesting primary producers were poorly adapted to pulses of low salinity. Trace metal spikes similarly had limited effects corroborating the hypothesis that inshore waters around Greenland and Antarctica are (micro)nutrient replete. The addition of small to moderately high sediment loads in the WAP, up to 500 mg L-1, did however produce a positive effect on chlorophyll a, and notable shifts in bacteria and eukaryote abundances. Given the lack of response to trace metal additions, this points towards the multiple mechanisms via which suspended sediment affects ecosystem dynamics which may include hosting bacterial communities, a decrease in viral load, grazing suppression and shading in addition into moderating micronutrient availability.",2023-05-22,2023-05-22,Rm 5583 (lift 29-30),HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

While the protests were dominated by the debates over the identities of Hongkongers versus mainland Chinese, they also produced discussions over the positions and experiences of Hong Kong's ""ethnic minorities,"" many of whom are religious minorities. Often racialized and seen as outsiders by Han Hongkongers, ethnoreligious minorities were reluctant to take sides, worried for their livelihoods and fearing further marginalization. This sharply contrasts with the visibility of Christian communities in the protests: Christian leaders were publicly involved in prayer meetings and other forms of support for the protests, while the followers of minority religions either stayed away or organized prayer sessions in private, small settings. However, around October 2019, after a series of unprecedented events, minorities either found themselves drawn into or took an opportunity to participate in the protests to claim their Hongkonger identity. This was a potential for expanding the political discourse and creating a unified multicultural, multiracial identity for Hongkongers. However, such aspirations got crushed against the walls of cultural-religious representation, and minorities felt that they remained misunderstood and unacknowledged as fellow citizens.  Biography:Venera Khalikova is Assistant Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

展覽選取四部經典名劇為主題，分別為葉紹德的編劇作品《梁山伯與祝英台》及《穆桂英大破洪州》、唐滌生改編的《帝女花》以及李少芸編寫的《連城璧》，每齣戲寶皆以不同時代背景的故事主題為核心，呈現粵劇劇種的多元性。劇作家針對相關題材及敘事結構，編上曲牌（傳統曲調調名）和口白（對白唸詞），創作及改編出齣齣好戲。除了文學修養和寫作技巧，劇作家也必須把演員出入場的方式、換裝的時間、舞台佈景的轉換等細節納入考量，因此必須對粵劇台前幕後的運作有所掌握。

除了精湛的劇本，角色的描繪、佈景的安排以及服飾的搭配也十分講究。人物方面，以四部劇中折子戲裡的主角作展示，其構成包括皇室宗親、達官貴人、武打將領乃至平民百姓等人物。這樣的安排旨在將粵劇的經典人物及其服飾穿搭，分別以蟒、靠、褶及帔四種主要的粵劇服飾類別，及佈景道具的搭配作展示。展覽分別在科大圖書館和逸夫演藝中心以實體和多媒體形式展出，內容豐富，不容錯過。

粵劇的發展隨時代演變不斷，其豐富的表演元素和獨特的表現形式值得大家持續發掘。是次展覽希望打開觀眾對粵劇文化藝術的認識，並在未來有更多接觸粵劇的機會。

 

Cantonese opera is a unique genre of performing art in the Lingnan area in southern China. It applies singing, acting, recitation and martial arts to a large variety of drama plots, and combines stage design, costume design and music accompaniment to become a folk art in the traditional society. The earliest known records of performances by Cantonese opera troupes in Hong Kong can be traced back to the mid-19th century, and the relatively liberal social atmosphere and affluent material life favored a rapid development in post-war Hong Kong. In 2009, in recognition of its historical significance and cultural value, Cantonese opera was inscribed onto UNESCO’s Representative List of World Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Despite its high cultural status, Cantonese opera is struggling to maintain a sustainable development, a challenge posed by the rapid expansion of entertainment businesses in past decades. HKUST Center for the Arts and the Library co-organize the exhibition as a major event of HKUST Arts Festival 2023. It echoes the theme of AF2023, Arts in Multicultural Hong Kong, to present and hopefully to revive this precious cultural heritage of Hong Kong.

The exhibition focuses on four well-known Cantonese operas, namely, The Butterfly Lovers and Muk Gwai-ying Routing Hongzhou by Yip Shiu-tak, The Floral Princess by Tong Dik-sang and The Priceless Jade by Lee Siu-wan, selected based on the diversity of historical backgrounds and themes, to reflect the wide spectrum of the art form. In the creative process of the librettos, the librettists had to arrange traditional tunes, lyrics and dialogues according to the contents and narrative structure of the drama. In addition to having a profound knowledge of Chinese literature and outstanding writing skills, they had to be familiar with performing routines and stage operation, setting out in the plays details such as how actors appear on the stage, timing for costume change and change of scenes, to name just a few.

The four operas are not only renowned for the excellent screenwriting and portrayal of characters, their stage sets and costume designs are also artworks in their own right. The main characters on display in their respective stage sets here are selected to feature royalties, dignitaries, battle commandants, and last but not least, ordinary people, to illustrate the four major types of Cantonese opera outfits, namely, python ceremonial robes, armor, gowns with a sloping collar (casual clothing for ordinary people) and gowns with a vertical collar (casual clothing for dignitaries), together with their matching headgears. Visitors will discover the beauty of these artefacts and interact with multimedia presentations in the Library and the foyer of Shaw Auditorium.

In its development over a long period of time, Cantonese opera has evolved into a multitudinous performing art form with unique formats of expression. Through presenting the fundamentals of Cantonese opera, this exhibition hopes to inspire the public to explore further opportunities to appreciate this precious art.",2023-04-03,2023-07-31,,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

Kent Collection. The late Mr. Walter R. Kent (1941 - 2016) was interested in maps and items relate to aviation; he collected maps, posters, and aircraft models through years. His maps reflect the traces of his life from his birthplace New York through Asia, eventually reaching Hong Kong as his home of retirement. In 2019, his collection was generously donated to the HKUST Library. This exhibition is made possible by the thoughtful contributions of his loyal friends and companions. 

Aeroplane models lead you to this exhibition at the Special Collections Gallery in the Library. “The Spotlights” encircle Mr. Kent’s love of cities and highlight the collection on two levels. On a personal level, it unfolds the becoming of a very private collection, characterized by city maps in his lifelong journey. On an academic level, the richness of his map collection adds value to the Special Collections at the HKUST Library. 

The maps, posters, objects, sound recordings and photos in this exhibition will give you a glimpse of an emotional trip through Asian cities and, at the same time, sketch how this very personal collection came into place and remains a vivid witness of its time. Very much appreciated are the voice recordings and objects of friends and companions throughout Mr. Kent’s life journey that enrich and contextualise the collection and his friendships.   ",2023-05-04,2023-09-08,"['The Hong Kong Chiu Chow Chamber of Commerce Ko Pui Shuen Gallery', '1/F Library']",HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

Inspired by profit and the need to chase the foreign tuition dollar, such expansionary efforts have met with different degrees of success. However, as world economic growth starts to recede and nationalist sentiments rise, we have witnessed a curtailing, and in some cases withdrawal, of these transnational endeavours. Adopting an ecological approach to better understand this educational phenomenon, I investigate how English monolingual biases and an emergent interest and pride in local languages within several countries that have hosted joint venture foreign campuses have been negotiated. Specifically, I explore the ways in which different social actors – students, faculty and administrators – engage in complex identity work that often results in individuals being sorted and sieved according to the various levels of capital that they possess. These actors’ strategic policy and pedagogical decisions will also be unpacked against mounting internal pressures by governments to raise the standards of local universities in the face of stiff global university ranking competition.   Biography:Peter I.

Central to our analysis is an accounting for the dynamics of trade flows, observed trade policy, and expectations about future policy. In our empirical analysis, we estimate the dynamics of the elasticity of Chinese exports to (i) past tariff changes and (ii) the risk of future tariff hikes. We find Chinese exports responded slowly to the tariff changes that occurred when China was granted most-favored-nation status in 1980, and that policy uncertainty was more important in the immediate aftermath of this liberalization than in the lead-up to China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization. However, separately identifying these two effects using data alone is difficult. In our quantitative analysis, we disentangle these effects by using a structural model to estimate a path of trade-policy expectations. We find the 1980 reform was largely a surprise and initially had a high probability of being reversed. The likelihood of reversal dropped considerably during the mid 1980s but changed little throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s despite China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.",2023-05-24,2023-05-24,Online via Zoom,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

The speaker will give an overview on non-invertible global symmetries based on a series of works done in the past year. In particular, he will discuss how the Krammers-Wannier duality of the 2d Ising model can be understood as a non-invertible global symmetry. Then, the speaker will discuss a new non-invertible global symmetry in QED and real-world QCD in the massless limit and show that the neutral pion decay can be understood as a consequence of this generalized global symmetry. He will conclude with a summary highlighting some of the important progress on this subject.

Throughout the Mao years, the countryside received few modern inputs. Most labor was performed by human and animal muscle rather than by machines. Most fertilizer was organic, laboriously collected and composted from human and animal excrement and other organic matter. Most heating in rural households came from crop residues or firewood collected in the hills. At the same time, the urban-industrial sector transitioned from an organic to a fossil-fuel energy regime, powered by coal and petrol. For about two decades, the government expected the rural-agrarian sector to expand at the same pace as the urban-industrial sector, despite the fact that the countryside had little access to output-boosting fossil fuels. This led, on the one hand, to a rural energy crisis, as the same limited resources of land and organic matter were needed to meet conflicting demands for fuel, fodder, compost, etc. and, on the other hand, to labor intensification at the household level, as women and children were mobilized to fill the gaps resulting from extraction.Biography:Jacob Eyferth is a social historian of China with research interests in the life and work experience of non-elite people throughout the twentieth century. Most of his work has focused on the countryside and on the mid-twentieth century, c. 1920-1970. His first book, Eating Rice from Bamboo Roots, is an ethnographic history of a community of rural papermakers in Sichuan. He is currently working on a second book, tentatively titled Cotton, Gender, and Revolution in Twentieth-Century China, that uses cloth and clothing as a lens through which to analyze how the monumental changes of the twentieth century – revolution, collectivization, industrialization, etc. – transformed the lives of rural women.",2023-05-25,2023-05-25,"['Room 3401', '(Lift no. 17-18)']",HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

The integration of networks is clearly beneficial in view of designing optimal sustainable energy systems, but their heavily interconnected nature makes them vulnerable to cascading failures with potentially catastrophic consequences. This talk addresses the grand challenges and presents the methodological developments necessary to guide the evolution of energy infrastructure through vulnerability-based adaptation. They encompass (i) the development of high-fidelity, efficient mathematical models for quantifying the risk of cascading failures across the interdependent infrastructure; (ii) understanding the impact of the water-energy nexus on electrical energy conversion and mitigating its effect in the face of climate change; (iii) developing and validating early warning indicators of critical transitions and fault diagnosis tools in complex dynamical systems.

A Transformer-based deep direct sampling method is proposed for solving a class of boundary value inverse problem. A real-time reconstruction is achieved by evaluating the learned inverse operator between carefully designed data and the reconstructed images. An effort is made to give a case study for a fundamental and critical question: whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep neural networks? Inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions in different frequency input channels. Then, by introducing a learnable non-local kernel, the approximation of direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The proposed method is then applied to electrical impedance tomography, a well-known severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners, as well as shows robustness with respect to noise. This research shall strengthen the insights that the attention mechanism, despite being invented for natural language processing tasks, offers great flexibility to be modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures.For Attendees' Attention

To achieve fourth-order accuracy in space, two main ingredients are proposed in the SL FV formulation. Firstly, we introduce a so-called cubic-curved quadrilateral upstream cell and applying an efficient clipping method to evaluate integrals on upstream cells. Secondly, we construct a new WENO reconstruction operator, which recovers a P3 polynomial from neighboring cell averages. Mass conservation is accomplished with the mass conservative nature of the reconstruction operator and the SL formulation. A positivity-preserving limiter is applied to maintain the positivity of the numerical solution wherever appropriate. For nonlinear kinetic models, the SL scheme is coupled with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta exponential integrator for high-order temporal accuracy.

We discuss new possible tunneling processes in the presence of gravity. We formulate quantum tunneling using the Wheeler-deWitt canonical quantization and the WKB approximation. The distinctive feature of our formulation is that it accommodates the coexistence of Euclidean and Lorentzian evolution. It opens up a new possibility of quantum tunneling; e.g. a bubble wall itself tunnels the potential barrier pulling the field nearby, where the wall region experiences the Euclidean evolution while the other regions experience the Lorentzian evolution simultaneously. We execute numerical analysis and find that such a process can have a much higher tunneling rate than that of the Coleman-De Luccia bounce. We also find that the new tunneling processes exist even in the decoupling regime of gravity and affect low energy phenomenology.About the Speaker
