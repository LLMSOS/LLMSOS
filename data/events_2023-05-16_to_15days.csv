Traditionally, physical quantities near the critical point can be computed by perturbative field theory method, where conformal symmetry is not fully utilized. In this talk, I will explain how conformal symmetry can be used to determine certain physical quantities, without even knowing the fine details of the microscopic structure. To compute the observables precisely, one needs to develop powerful numerical techniques. In the last few years, we have invented many computational tools and algorithms, and predicted critical exponents of Helium-4 superfluid phase transition and Heisenberg magnet to very high precision.",2023-05-16,2023-05-16,,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

Using supply side variation for identification, we demonstrate that the average elasticity of city population to aggregate city building heights is 0.12, and that of city built area to heights is -0.17. Land saved from development by post-1975 tall building construction is over 80% covered in vegetation. To isolate the effects of technology-induced reductions in the cost of height from correlated demand shocks, we use interactions of static demand differences and the geography of bedrock as instruments for observed changes in height, a triple difference identification strategy. Central to the analysis is newly organized data on the population, land area, and a measure of total height for 1975-2015 in 12,877 cities worldwide. Quantification using a canonical urban model suggests that global welfare has increased by 1.1% as a result of declines in the cost of height.

展覽選取四部經典名劇為主題，分別為葉紹德的編劇作品《梁山伯與祝英台》及《穆桂英大破洪州》、唐滌生改編的《帝女花》以及李少芸編寫的《連城璧》，每齣戲寶皆以不同時代背景的故事主題為核心，呈現粵劇劇種的多元性。劇作家針對相關題材及敘事結構，編上曲牌（傳統曲調調名）和口白（對白唸詞），創作及改編出齣齣好戲。除了文學修養和寫作技巧，劇作家也必須把演員出入場的方式、換裝的時間、舞台佈景的轉換等細節納入考量，因此必須對粵劇台前幕後的運作有所掌握。

除了精湛的劇本，角色的描繪、佈景的安排以及服飾的搭配也十分講究。人物方面，以四部劇中折子戲裡的主角作展示，其構成包括皇室宗親、達官貴人、武打將領乃至平民百姓等人物。這樣的安排旨在將粵劇的經典人物及其服飾穿搭，分別以蟒、靠、褶及帔四種主要的粵劇服飾類別，及佈景道具的搭配作展示。展覽分別在科大圖書館和逸夫演藝中心以實體和多媒體形式展出，內容豐富，不容錯過。

粵劇的發展隨時代演變不斷，其豐富的表演元素和獨特的表現形式值得大家持續發掘。是次展覽希望打開觀眾對粵劇文化藝術的認識，並在未來有更多接觸粵劇的機會。

 

Cantonese opera is a unique genre of performing art in the Lingnan area in southern China. It applies singing, acting, recitation and martial arts to a large variety of drama plots, and combines stage design, costume design and music accompaniment to become a folk art in the traditional society. The earliest known records of performances by Cantonese opera troupes in Hong Kong can be traced back to the mid-19th century, and the relatively liberal social atmosphere and affluent material life favored a rapid development in post-war Hong Kong. In 2009, in recognition of its historical significance and cultural value, Cantonese opera was inscribed onto UNESCO’s Representative List of World Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Despite its high cultural status, Cantonese opera is struggling to maintain a sustainable development, a challenge posed by the rapid expansion of entertainment businesses in past decades. HKUST Center for the Arts and the Library co-organize the exhibition as a major event of HKUST Arts Festival 2023. It echoes the theme of AF2023, Arts in Multicultural Hong Kong, to present and hopefully to revive this precious cultural heritage of Hong Kong.

The exhibition focuses on four well-known Cantonese operas, namely, The Butterfly Lovers and Muk Gwai-ying Routing Hongzhou by Yip Shiu-tak, The Floral Princess by Tong Dik-sang and The Priceless Jade by Lee Siu-wan, selected based on the diversity of historical backgrounds and themes, to reflect the wide spectrum of the art form. In the creative process of the librettos, the librettists had to arrange traditional tunes, lyrics and dialogues according to the contents and narrative structure of the drama. In addition to having a profound knowledge of Chinese literature and outstanding writing skills, they had to be familiar with performing routines and stage operation, setting out in the plays details such as how actors appear on the stage, timing for costume change and change of scenes, to name just a few.

The four operas are not only renowned for the excellent screenwriting and portrayal of characters, their stage sets and costume designs are also artworks in their own right. The main characters on display in their respective stage sets here are selected to feature royalties, dignitaries, battle commandants, and last but not least, ordinary people, to illustrate the four major types of Cantonese opera outfits, namely, python ceremonial robes, armor, gowns with a sloping collar (casual clothing for ordinary people) and gowns with a vertical collar (casual clothing for dignitaries), together with their matching headgears. Visitors will discover the beauty of these artefacts and interact with multimedia presentations in the Library and the foyer of Shaw Auditorium.

In its development over a long period of time, Cantonese opera has evolved into a multitudinous performing art form with unique formats of expression. Through presenting the fundamentals of Cantonese opera, this exhibition hopes to inspire the public to explore further opportunities to appreciate this precious art.",2023-04-03,2023-07-31,,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

Kent Collection. The late Mr. Walter R. Kent (1941 - 2016) was interested in maps and items relate to aviation; he collected maps, posters, and aircraft models through years. His maps reflect the traces of his life from his birthplace New York through Asia, eventually reaching Hong Kong as his home of retirement. In 2019, his collection was generously donated to the HKUST Library. This exhibition is made possible by the thoughtful contributions of his loyal friends and companions. 

Aeroplane models lead you to this exhibition at the Special Collections Gallery in the Library. “The Spotlights” encircle Mr. Kent’s love of cities and highlight the collection on two levels. On a personal level, it unfolds the becoming of a very private collection, characterized by city maps in his lifelong journey. On an academic level, the richness of his map collection adds value to the Special Collections at the HKUST Library. 

The maps, posters, objects, sound recordings and photos in this exhibition will give you a glimpse of an emotional trip through Asian cities and, at the same time, sketch how this very personal collection came into place and remains a vivid witness of its time.

Alternatively, periodic models establish separate models for individual seasons. However, the setting of periodic models cannot guarantee the smoothness in model coefficients which is necessary when the time scale is small (for example, daily). In this talk, we propose the use of functional-coefficient models with a periodic component, which extend the periodic regression for short-term forecasting. Unlike the traditional functional-coefficient models which extend the threshold regression model, our functional-coefficient model with a periodic component enjoys an invariance property under data differencing. As case studies, the models are applied to Australian streamflows.

Bringing sensing and augmentation functions to the intimate surfaces of biological systems underpins technological advances in precision health, biology-machine interactions, and basic scientific discoveries. Contemporary wearable and on-skin sensing devices, produced by centralized mass manufacturing, are usually standardized, rigid, and invariable; they are intrinsically incompatible with the diversity, delicacy, and dynamism of living systems. Fibers and textiles are flexible and breathable, making them ideal for long-term skin-contacting purposes. I developed additive manufacturing approaches to synthesis microfibers and assemble into wearable and bio-interfacing devices in the format of microtextiles. With the fully printed organic and soft sensors, I have explored applications from remote healthcare, environmental detection, to adaptive wearables. In the future, I propose to explore adaptive and sustainable fabrication routes to produce user-centric wearable and implantable devices. In doing so, my research will unleash emerging possibilities to foster information exchange and augmentation for biological systems, without perturbing their normal physiological functions.",2023-05-17,2023-05-17,Zoom ID: 933 9104 4020  Passcode: 034294,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

In the first part of this talk, I will demonstrate to apply atomic layer deposition/molecular layer deposition (ALD/MLD) for interface design between sulfide-based electrolyte and cathode material. Compared with polymer-based and oxide-based electrolytes, sulfide-based electrolyte generally exhibits the highest ionic conductivity (10-3 ~ 10-2 S/cm) and favorable mechanical property. However, the serious interfacial challenge, bad air stability, narrow electrochemical windows of sulfide-based electrolyte significantly impede development of sulfide-based ASSLBs . Generally, an artificial, uniform and ultrathin interfacial layer is critical to address these challenges. ALD) and MLD are unique coating techniques that can realize excellent coverage and conformal deposition with precisely controllable at the nanoscale level due to its self-limiting nature, which are ideal for addressing the challenges of interface in SSLBs. 

In the second part of this talk, I will talk about halide-based electrolyte for ASSLBs. Compared with sulfide-based electrolyte, both experimental and theoretical results recently demonstrate that halide-based electrolytes have more advantages including high RT ionic conductivity (>10-3 S cm-1, theoretically possible 10-2 S cm-1), wide electrochemically stable window (possible up to 6 V), high air-stability, good stability toward oxide cathode materials, and even salable water synthesis strategy.",2023-05-17,2023-05-17,"['Room 1410 (Near LT-F', 'Lifts 25-26)']",HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

We measured effects on labor market outcomes, well-being, social relationships, and work satisfaction, as well as on labor intermediation costs, assets and debt. We find that workers who received the randomized offer experienced 30% higher earnings, and migrating to the UAE doubled their compensation. However, they also paid substantial upfront costs to labor intermediaries, financed by additional debt, that reduces take-home pay by up to 10%. Workers offered a UAE job also experienced more diverse friendship and co-worker networks, but also report a significant fall in subjective well-being. This is consistent with the large share of workers offered jobs that do not migrate to the UAE. Extrapolating using a linear marginal treatment effects framework, we find large and positive pecuniary returns to migration for workers offered a UAE job who decline, as well as significant non-pecuniary costs, which help rationalize the lack of take-up.",2023-05-17,2023-05-17,Online via Zoom,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

However, seamless integration is a grand challenge because of the distinct nature between electronics and human body. Conventional electronics are rigid and planar, made out of rigid materials. Human body are soft, deformable and curvilinear, comprised of biological materials, organs and tissues. This talk will introduce our solution to address the challenge through a few emerging electronics and bioelectronics technologies, such as stretchable electronics and most recently rubbery electronics.  By taking the advantage of the enable mechanics of ultra-thin, open-mesh structures, conventionally non-stretchable electronic materials could become mechanically stretchable. Special mechanical structures or architectures accommodate or eliminate mechanical strain in the non-stretchable materials while stretched. Stretchable electronics in this fashion allow integration with skin, organ and tissues. On contrary, rubbery electronics is constructed all based on elastic rubber electronic materials of semiconductors, conductors and dielectrics, which possesses tissue-like softness and mechanical stretchability to allow seamless integration with soft deformable tissues and organs. Rubbery electronic materials and device innovations set the foundation for rubbery electronics.

Using the setting of a diplomatic dispute, we randomize the reputations for honesty for each side to identify the diplomatic premium (or discount) of a good (or bad) reputation. We show for the first time that reputation has both offensive and defensive values: One’s reputation can significantly undercut the other’s credibility while protecting one’s credibility from challenge at the same time. Separately, we also randomize regime type to identify the existence of a dyadic democratic premium for credibility, with useful implications for democratic peace.

In the conventional statistical framework, a major goal is to develop optimal statistical procedures based on the sample size and statistical model. However, in many contemporary applications, non-statistical concerns such as privacy and communication constraints associated with the statistical procedures become crucial. This raises a fundamental question in data science: how can we make optimal statistical inference under these non-statistical constraints? In this talk, the speaker will explore recent advances in differentially private learning and distributed learning under communication constraints in a few specific settings.

Abstract:

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) techniques are vital to reaching decarbonization goals. Using nationwide CCUS data and property-level housing transaction records in the U.S., we quantify the impact of CCUS projects on nearby property values. Our research reveals three main findings. First, within 15 km of a CCUS project, property values decrease by 10.18% on average and the impact is heterogeneous depending on the property proximity. Second, a CCUS project’s negative impact varies across the project types and facility conditions. The value of a property decreases by 9.88% and 6.42% after a carbon capture-only and a carbon storage-only project is operational within 15 km of the property, respectively. Retrofit CCUS facilities have no significant impact on nearby housing prices, whereas new-built CCUS facilities significantly reduce nearby house prices by 10.68%. Third, we apply a DDD approach to distinguish between CCUS effects and oil basin effects on housing prices and find that the CCUS operation has a net impact of -17.84% on nearby housing prices when compared to similar houses in oil basins without CCUS operations. Our mechanism analysis indicates that the increase in house prices resulting from CCUS within 5 km may be attributed to the implementation of CCUS projects which capture carbon emissions and improve local air quality. Reduced house prices within 15 km of CCUS projects may be attributed to a decrease in both local economic development and air quality. We also explore the heterogeneous responses of CCUS operations based on environmental awareness, local economic activities, and the facility industry. Our paper provides important policy implications on the local economic impacts and the siting choices of CCUS projects. The study provides useful insights into how CCUS projects may be expanded efficiently. We also apply a similar method to the data in China and find that on average, property values decrease by 5.5%-5.9% after the construction of a CCUS facility within a 3.6 km distance.",2023-05-18,2023-05-18,Zoom ID：961 4574 5264 Passcode: ipe,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

This talk consists of two topics. The first problem we consider is obtaining energy flux across scales from measured data, which can be achieved by analyzing the third-order structure functions. We generalize the classic inertial-range theories to capture the bidirectional energy flux and energy injection scale. Using the new theory, we analyze the summer and winter drifter data obtained from the Gulf of Mexico and find that (i) bidirectional energy flux exists and (ii) the dominant kinetic energy sources are the baroclinic instabilities associated with the ocean depth and the mixed-layer depth. The second one relates to the energy puzzle of mesoscale eddies, whose energy injection is much larger than the known energy dissipation. The estimation of mesoscale energy flux is mainly based on the quasigeostrophic theory, where energy cascade upscales and finally dissipates at the boundaries. However, inertia-gravity waves may modify this energy flux picture qualitatively. We study this problem using an asymptotically derived model that captures the interaction between near-inertial waves and mesoscale eddies. This model has a Hamiltonian structure and preserves conserved quantities such as the total energy, potential enstrophy and wave action, based on which we argue the existence of wave-induced downscale energy flux, which is overlooked in the mesoscale energy budget. We numerically study the turbulent states of this model and find that the wave-induced downscale flux of mesoscale energy can be substantial, which provides a candidate to resolve the energy puzzle of mesoscale eddies. An implication of jet formation on a beta-plane is also presented.",2023-05-19,2023-05-19,Rm 5583 (lift 29-30),HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

By combining cruise water column observations, with remote sensing of chlorophyll and bioassay experiments we can however gain some insight into the links between liquid/solid ice sheet discharge and marine biogeochemistry. In addition to physical effects from icebergs and glaciers mixing the water column, the release of high sediment loads may negatively affect light availability or prove fatal to grazers. Conversely the release of trace metals associated with iceberg/glacier melt could have fertilizing effects on phytoplankton. By combining an extensive compilation of 500 ice meltwater samples for (micro)nutrient content with incubation experiments in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and Greenland to test the response of phytoplankton communities to increasing freshwater and sediment, we aim to increase understanding of cryosphere-ocean linkages.

Whilst iceberg melt was consistently found to act as a modest source of (micro)nutrients, particularly the bioessential trace metals iron and manganese (mean concentrations 88 nM dFe, 29 nM dMn, 0.64 µM dSi), the response of primary producers in both Greenland and the WAP to increasing meltwater was limited suggesting trace metal concentrations were already replete in the water column. Furthermore, in the WAP a negative response was observed when salinity declined by more than 2 psu suggesting primary producers were poorly adapted to pulses of low salinity. Trace metal spikes similarly had limited effects corroborating the hypothesis that inshore waters around Greenland and Antarctica are (micro)nutrient replete. The addition of small to moderately high sediment loads in the WAP, up to 500 mg L-1, did however produce a positive effect on chlorophyll a, and notable shifts in bacteria and eukaryote abundances. Given the lack of response to trace metal additions, this points towards the multiple mechanisms via which suspended sediment affects ecosystem dynamics which may include hosting bacterial communities, a decrease in viral load, grazing suppression and shading in addition into moderating micronutrient availability.",2023-05-22,2023-05-22,Rm 5583 (lift 29-30),HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

While the protests were dominated by the debates over the identities of Hongkongers versus mainland Chinese, they also produced discussions over the positions and experiences of Hong Kong's ""ethnic minorities,"" many of whom are religious minorities. Often racialized and seen as outsiders by Han Hongkongers, ethnoreligious minorities were reluctant to take sides, worried for their livelihoods and fearing further marginalization. This sharply contrasts with the visibility of Christian communities in the protests: Christian leaders were publicly involved in prayer meetings and other forms of support for the protests, while the followers of minority religions either stayed away or organized prayer sessions in private, small settings. However, around October 2019, after a series of unprecedented events, minorities either found themselves drawn into or took an opportunity to participate in the protests to claim their Hongkonger identity. This was a potential for expanding the political discourse and creating a unified multicultural, multiracial identity for Hongkongers. However, such aspirations got crushed against the walls of cultural-religious representation, and minorities felt that they remained misunderstood and unacknowledged as fellow citizens.  Biography:Venera Khalikova is Assistant Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Inspired by profit and the need to chase the foreign tuition dollar, such expansionary efforts have met with different degrees of success. However, as world economic growth starts to recede and nationalist sentiments rise, we have witnessed a curtailing, and in some cases withdrawal, of these transnational endeavours. Adopting an ecological approach to better understand this educational phenomenon, I investigate how English monolingual biases and an emergent interest and pride in local languages within several countries that have hosted joint venture foreign campuses have been negotiated. Specifically, I explore the ways in which different social actors – students, faculty and administrators – engage in complex identity work that often results in individuals being sorted and sieved according to the various levels of capital that they possess. These actors’ strategic policy and pedagogical decisions will also be unpacked against mounting internal pressures by governments to raise the standards of local universities in the face of stiff global university ranking competition.   Biography:Peter I.

Central to our analysis is an accounting for the dynamics of trade flows, observed trade policy, and expectations about future policy. In our empirical analysis, we estimate the dynamics of the elasticity of Chinese exports to (i) past tariff changes and (ii) the risk of future tariff hikes. We find Chinese exports responded slowly to the tariff changes that occurred when China was granted most-favored-nation status in 1980, and that policy uncertainty was more important in the immediate aftermath of this liberalization than in the lead-up to China’s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization. However, separately identifying these two effects using data alone is difficult. In our quantitative analysis, we disentangle these effects by using a structural model to estimate a path of trade-policy expectations. We find the 1980 reform was largely a surprise and initially had a high probability of being reversed. The likelihood of reversal dropped considerably during the mid 1980s but changed little throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s despite China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.",2023-05-24,2023-05-24,Online via Zoom,HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk

The speaker will give an overview on non-invertible global symmetries based on a series of works done in the past year. In particular, he will discuss how the Krammers-Wannier duality of the 2d Ising model can be understood as a non-invertible global symmetry. Then, the speaker will discuss a new non-invertible global symmetry in QED and real-world QCD in the massless limit and show that the neutral pion decay can be understood as a consequence of this generalized global symmetry. He will conclude with a summary highlighting some of the important progress on this subject.

A Transformer-based deep direct sampling method is proposed for solving a class of boundary value inverse problem. A real-time reconstruction is achieved by evaluating the learned inverse operator between carefully designed data and the reconstructed images. An effort is made to give a case study for a fundamental and critical question: whether and how one can benefit from the theoretical structure of a mathematical problem to develop task-oriented and structure-conforming deep neural networks? Inspired by direct sampling methods for inverse problems, the 1D boundary data are preprocessed by a partial differential equation-based feature map to yield 2D harmonic extensions in different frequency input channels. Then, by introducing a learnable non-local kernel, the approximation of direct sampling is recast to a modified attention mechanism. The proposed method is then applied to electrical impedance tomography, a well-known severely ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. The new method achieves superior accuracy over its predecessors and contemporary operator learners, as well as shows robustness with respect to noise. This research shall strengthen the insights that the attention mechanism, despite being invented for natural language processing tasks, offers great flexibility to be modified in conformity with the a priori mathematical knowledge, which ultimately leads to the design of more physics-compatible neural architectures.For Attendees' Attention

To achieve fourth-order accuracy in space, two main ingredients are proposed in the SL FV formulation. Firstly, we introduce a so-called cubic-curved quadrilateral upstream cell and applying an efficient clipping method to evaluate integrals on upstream cells. Secondly, we construct a new WENO reconstruction operator, which recovers a P3 polynomial from neighboring cell averages. Mass conservation is accomplished with the mass conservative nature of the reconstruction operator and the SL formulation. A positivity-preserving limiter is applied to maintain the positivity of the numerical solution wherever appropriate. For nonlinear kinetic models, the SL scheme is coupled with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta exponential integrator for high-order temporal accuracy. Extensive bench marks are tested to verify the designed properties.",2023-05-31,2023-05-31,Room 5510 (Lifts 25/26),HK,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,https://www.ust.hk
